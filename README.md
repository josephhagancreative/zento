## Zento JPN Website

Please view the live version of the website here: [Zento JPN Website](https://www.zento-jpn.com/)

### Introduction

This is a website for my Japanese language learning youtube channel. I made it just as a fun project to try out some different technologies and have a hub for my social accounts.

### Technologies

I created this website using NextJS and it fetches blog posts from Contentful and videos and data from the YouTube API. this allowed me to simply create a page for every blog post based on the url slug, and display content that updates daily using static props.

### Features to add

1. Things to fix
   ..\* image size consistency and file size
2. Things to add
   .._ make statistic numbers count up on homepage
   .._ create mail form that goes direct to email
